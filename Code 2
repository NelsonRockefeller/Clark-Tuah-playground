Democrats nationwide ran on four words: "He Killed Social Security." The McCain administration knew this insurmountable task was unpopular, and his trips throughout the states to make the bill to reform the system seem popular only hurt its public view. McCain's refusal to cut taxes as a compromise for the bill eliminated all and any support from the opposition. However, what hurt him most was the collapse of the support within the Republican base. The old folk who relied on Social Security felt uncomfortable with his reforms. Regardless, by the summer of 09, he didn't seem to waver in supporting such a plan.</p><p>Public opinion hit a boiling point, but McCain still had the numbers to get what he wanted to be passed. So he ignored the normality of representing the people and forced upon America a "tough pill to swallow." Democrats tried to pull any tricks they could to combat the bill, but they lacked the numbers to stop it, and Republicans sent the bill through. Well, now, here we are. The American people have rejected the McCain administration's pill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has the numbers to comfortably stalemate whatever McCain may bring from here. It looks like President McCain has accepted the fact that his domestic agenda has been slain and has set his eyes abroad.

The veteran Senator, whose poll numbers had surged to astronomical numbers in September, came crashing down by election day.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts on all sides of the aisle were scratching their heads. How could this happen? President Clark had completely crashed his campaign by attacking Senator McCain's service.</p><p>Clark's apology for such remarks was equally unpopular and most pathetic. The President's approval rating with veterans had dropped to dangerously low levels.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Senator's hopes and dreams faded on election night.</p><p>Eight years after his original presidential campaign in 2000, Senator McCain often came off as a polished statesman with a respectable record.</p><p>But the surprise outcome isn't one without some reasoning. The Senator's selection of Democrat Joe Lieberman had stirred much criticism from his right flank, culminating in the surge of the Reform Party nominee Pat Buchanan.</p><p>In a solemn concession speech, Senator McCain reflected on his own mistakes and offered nothing but goodwill to the President.</p><p>"This was a difficult campaign but I'm proud of our enthusiastic support," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Phoenix.

<p><b>Miami (Reuters) - </b>- Republican Jeb Bush lost Tuesday's presidential election in an upset at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The now 3rd member of the Bush Clan to grasp the Republican Nomination for President failed to make his case to the voters.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts on all sides of the aisle were blown away. How could this happen? With the financial crisis and Iraq in turmoil, this election seemed like a shoe victory to most.</p><p>Clark's actions left him entirely exposed to easy attacks from the right. Neoconservative icons were crawling out of the woodwork it lambast his foreign policy.</p><p>But despite all these factors, including a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the former Governor met the same fate his brother did four years prior and his father faced in 1992.</p><p>Just 4 years ago, President George W. Bush's political career ended with General Clark in what many also called a shocking upset. At the time, it was unthinkable that the man who oversaw the events of 9/11, sporting a once untouchable approval rating, could fall flat in spectacular fashion.</p><p>Now, with his brother meeting a similar fate in what should have been even easier circumstances, most are asking if the Bush name is a curse or if Wesley Clark is untouchable.</p><p>In a bewildered concession speech, the former Governor congratulated the President and spoke of the need to unite behind the President during this crisis.</p><p>"These results may not be what we all wanted, but that doesn't take away from the issues we brought attention to during this campaign," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Miami. "I hope President Clark takes note of this and pray that he can lead our nation into a greater future during his second term."</p><pRepublican strategist John Feehery was equally baffled by the results, struggling to understand why he alluded to a gap between Bush and the Republican base.</p><p>"Governor Bush struggled to connect with key voting demographics below college educated voters. Possibly his immigration and education stances being liberally prone like his primary opponents often highlighted."</p><p>The primary opponent Feehery is referring to was Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who often attacked Bush for his weak stance on immigration and suggested many dedicated Republicans could be turned off by it.</p><p><b>OUT OF TOUCH, EASILY EXPOSED</b></p><p>It's hard not to blame the range of different avenues Democrats could attack Bush from, whether it was his handling of the Schiavo Case, unpopular social issues stances, or even the controversy surrounding the 2000 Florida recounts brought up.</p><p>He first championed his foreign policy, attacking President Clark's handling of the war in Iraq. While media think tanks often agreed with Bush, exit polls display Iraq as either the 3rd or 4th most important issue of the election.</p><p>The financial crisis had put economic solutions at the forefront of people's concerns. While President Clark responded calmly and firmly, Governor Bush's proposals often didn't go far enough for voters. The offer of tax cuts and reigning in government spending during a crisis and calamity had fallen flat.</p><p>Aides of the Clark Administration seem equally bewildered by the outcome.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that anyone will ever have an easier and more advantaged political climate than Governor Bush was given." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Bush campaign officials say that the outcome was of huge disappointment and surprise to Jeb.</p><p>What about Ridge? To most, the selection of the former Pennsylvania Governor and Homeland Security Secretary did little to help sew toes with Bush's right flank, and in return, it brought about the underlying distrust of the George W. Bush Administration. As Secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge oversaw an era of massive oversight and human rights violations.</p><p>While the pick didn't damage Bush's relationship with Republicans, it didn't do much to excite them.</p><p>"Bush had promised to deliver on key Republican issues during the primaries but chose to run to the center once nominated," said Republican strategist David Kochul. "Ridge isn't to blame for the loss this was of Bush's doing and him alone."</p><p>Bush campaign manager Danny Diaz said Bush ran a stellar campaign, but President Clark had nailed him on minor issues. As a result, President Clark could trade votes he lost in states struck by the recession for votes in traditionally Democratic states.</p><p>"Nothing in the exit polls tell us Governor Bush was simply unpopular by name recognition, there's more to the story and I'd like people to understand these things are complicated," he said.</p><p>Editing by Alan Elsner</p><p>Our Standards: <br>The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</br></p>`)

<p><b>New York City (Reuters) - </b> Republican Rudy Giuliani lost Tuesday's presidential election in a humiliating defeat at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The celebrity Mayor, whose fame in politics could only be rivaled by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, was expected to take the polls by storm but came up short.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts said his many weaknesses were exposed little by little. The firefighter revolting, his affairs, his ties to Bernard Kerik—it all came crashing down on him.

Party strategists point to Giuliani's incoherent economic messaging, which ranged from conservative to the same "Nanny" approach he often criticized.</p><p>In a difficult-to-hear concession speech late Tuesday, the former Mayor reflected on the campaign and seemingly struggled to accept blame for his failure.</p><p>"When I think back to everything I accomplished this campaign, I'm proud of the work I've done for you," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in New York. We fought hard for those who felt abandoned by Democrats and for the people we lost on 9/11."</p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said Giuliani's deep ties to the Bush administration might have ended up becoming a net negative with sore wounds prevailing from Iraq.</p><p>"He was always seen next to Bush advisors like Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld. People who were well known to the general public as war propeteers."</p><p>The financial crisis that erupted in September had seemingly solidified Giuliani's victory to most, but in early October, evidence of him paying off a mistress with city funds resurfaced, blowing through much of the Mayor's lead.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, MASSIVE GAFFES</b></p><p>Giuliani deeply wounded himself after refusing to answer a question about whether or not he'd pardon his former associate Bernard Kerik if elected president. Among other gaffes, he often became his own worst enemy.</p><p>He championed himself as someone above it all while being in touch with people's needs. This backfired on many of his proposals, and Giuliani often came off as elitist and running on vanity.</p><p>The financial crisis also put Giuliani's "conservativism" under speculation. While President Clark came off as calm and strong in his response, the Mayor appeared aloof to what Americans needed.

The Libertarian-minded Congressman, whose unorthodox positions on most issues were expected to shake up the race heavily, sadly, it didn't shake how he hoped it would.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts said his repudiation of the establishment and Senator Rick Santorum's third-party bid were among his greatest challenges to overcome. The old newsletters, past racist and antisemitic remarks, his unpopular platform—it all came crashing down on him. President Clark dutifully exploited this to avoid the challenge of his revolting left flank and set the theme of the election on Paul's unpopularity.</p><p>Paul's unstable coalition, bound by opposing President Clark's neoliberalism, ran out of steam short of its destination, and whatever gains he made with left-wing activists cost him conservative votes in the South.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Congressman failed to grasp the fundamentals of most issues.</p><p>Eighteen years after his initial run for President with the libertarian label, he was expected to champion the anti-war coalition's banner, but a third-party sabotage candidacy drained him with key Republican demographics.</p><p>But Paul's greatest failure was of his own making. His record was electoral poison, especially when his stance on Social Security was brought to the forefront, scaring the Republican base of the 65-and-older crowd. Furthermore, he alienated the traditional Republican farm states with his outspoken criticism of farm subsidies.</p><p>In a tough-pill-to-swallow concession speech, the Representative noted the massive achievement this election was for the libertarian movement.</p><p>"We may have lost, but the ideas brought forth prove that the libertarian experiment can be accomplished," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Dallas. We fought hard against the establishment, and while the warmongering free-spending free-thinkers may have won this battle, the war for greater libertarian thought marches on!"</p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said Paul's inability to compromise with the Republican establishment did him in.</p><p>"There were very few appealing aspects of Ron Paul's candidacy to the average Republican voter. He was too relaxed on social issues and let's not even get started on his foreign policy."</p><p>The financial crisis that erupted in September had seemingly boosted confidence in his candidacy, but when it came to solutions to the crisis, the appeal slowly faded away.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, SCATHING SCRUTINY</b></p><p>Paul suffered heavy losses after his association with the Ron Paul Newsletter was brought to the forefront of the campaign, which highlighted past racist and antisemitic remarks.</p><p>He championed himself as the choice of both the anti-war left and right but found that these two groups were incompatible on several issues like abortion and economics.</p><p>The financial crisis initially vindicated Paul's platform as he championed ideas like ending the Federal Reserve. While President Clark focused on bailing financial institutions, Paul advocated smashing the established financial norms. The movement he sparked drew crowds, but its limited reach grew apparent when most desperately pleaded for a firm government response.</p><p>Aides say Paul's response to the crisis, while helping keep a dedicated following, did little to combat the stigma of Paul as a radical.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that any Republican will collapse in the fasion that the Paul campaign has." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Paul aides say the Congressman is bitter and frustrated over the surprisingly popular conservative party candidacy of Rick Santorum.</p><p>What about Johnson? To most, Paul's selection of former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson only doubled down on his outsider appeal and further drove a divide between Paul and the Republican establishment.</p><p>Paul's Press Secretary Jesse Benton commented that the Republican establishment lost them this campaign.</p><p>"There's no doubt that the Republican establishments refusal to get behind our campaign lost us this election," Benton told reporters at the Giuliani campaign headquarters in New York.

<p><b>Kansas City (Reuters) - </b>—Republican Sam Brownback lost Tuesday's presidential election at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The establishment Senator turned Tea Party preacher sought the full erratic support of the Republican base to bring a more traditionalist view to the American Government.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts pointed to one aspect of his campaign: hate. Sam Brownback campaigned on the rage of evangelical Christians, hoping to turn out a large and capable coalition, but his many weaknesses disturbed the moderates within the party. President Clark, by contrast, campaigned to stop hate of all forms, garnering his dedicated following as a result.</p><p>While Brownback's coalition was loyal and dedicated, he lacked support among key groups, especially those most concerned with foreign policy.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Senator failed to convince voters on fundamental issues.</p><p>Brownback's entry into politics was profoundly unrecognizable compared to the way he conducted this campaign. Once an advocate for bipartisanship, Brownback seemingly dropped all compromise within his heart after Clark pushed the Freedom To Marry Act.</p><p>The failure to compromise became Brownback's downfall as his full embrace of populist themes quickly eroded through the patience of establishment Republicans. Radical tax positions, even for a Republican, combined with his extreme views on abortion and dovish foreign policy, limited the range of his coalition.</p><p>In his concession speech, which was followed by a prayer, the Senator noted the massive, glorious movement that enveloped his campaign.</p><p>"I know this loss hangs heavy in our hearts but believe me when I say, we've accomplished more for our Christian faith during this campaign than anyone could have ever imagined." he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Kansas City. "I still dream of a day where our deeply religious population aren't held captive by activist governments and that dream is still within reach, we must keep fighting for our children, for our grandchildren and for Christ!"</p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said Brownback's deeply religious campaign reawakened a populist element within the Republican Party.</p><p>"The crowds he generated weren't just excited, they were frothing for change and praying in unison with him."</p><p>The financial crisis only encouraged the Senator to redouble his efforts on populist talking points like his great tax experiment and massive deregulations.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, TOO RADICAL</b></p><p>Brownback was committed to the idea that the separation between church and state had to be abolished, so much so that he mentioned his Christian faith in every facet of the campaign, from foreign policy to economics.</p><p>He championed himself as a Christian first and a senator second, which quickly gave his campaign a unique and colorful image.</p><p>The financial crisis had blown through President Clark's lead, and most believed Brownback could make a comeback in the same spirit as Bill Clinton in 1992. However, through laser-focused determination and inspiring leadership, President Clark was able to repel Brownback's gains and lead the nation through the crisis convincingly.</p><p>Aides said Brownback's plan for the government cuts, while appealing to a significant portion of his base, worried fiscal hawks, who were unsure how the United States could pay for such extreme tax cuts.</p><p>"It is a great sigh of relief that Senator Brownback's hateful campaign was rejected." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Brownback aides say the Senator is jubilant, seemingly believing his strategy was vindicated for coming as close as it did.</p><p>What about Bachmann?

<p><b>Remarks by the President</b></p> <p><b>The Briefing Room</b></p><p>10:43 A.M. EST</p> <p><b>THE PRESIDENT:</b>Good Morning, 2 years ago I promised you that I would protect marriage and firmly end the efforts of activist judges and state legislatures of trying to destroy the sanctity of our Christian faith.</p><p>I'm happy to announce that the Federal Marriage Amendment has passed the House by 237-198 and the Senate by 61-37. This is a monumental victory not only for protecting our faith but eliminating this pointless partisan issue.</p><p>The amendment declares that: (1) marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman; and (2) neither the U.S. Constitution nor the constitution of any state shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents of marriage be conferred upon any other union.</p><p>After more than two centuries of basic common decency being followed my hand was forced after rogue justices declared what a millennia of human experience had never dreamed of allowing. While I wish this issue could have solely been relegated to the states I understand that the people's voice must come before the voices of these activist judges.</p><p>I believe our nation can now truly pursue greater progress while still following the word of God. Human experience has proven that the commitment of a husband and wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society. The good nature of our society is reliant on these core beliefs. We all should and must follow the Bible, long has the government ignored its power. The separation of church and state was a norm not a rule and its time we realize that these norms cannot be followed if the government seeks to meddle in issues that the Bible is concerned with.</p><p>This is a great victory for all under God and I hope the American public comes to appreciate it.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>END 10:47 A.M.

<p><b>The American Health Insurance Connector Authority reveals a liberal steak to the all-but liberal President</b></p> <p>Published in August, 2011</p> <p>In a small, cramped back-room in the halls of the ever glamorous and historical West Wing we find President Romney, sitting alongside Senate leaders Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell. Reid looks at the President and inquires into his positivity in the project to reinvent the American Healthcare system. McConnell looks more glum than usual, selecting instead to stare in idly at the carpeted floors of this chosen room away from prying eyes. Romney glances at McConnell and asks if he can throw him a bone, McConnell shakes his head, The President then understood he was in fact going at this alone.</p><p>It was perhaps less unorthodox for a Republican to see to do something like this in Massachusetts, territory of the liberal-leaning Republican and the progressive democrat but in national politics the line of left-and-right was not so blurred, nor was the cameras not as bright. His next steps were going to be covered thoroughly, so he’d have to tread carefully.</b></p><p>Months of cajoling, talks across the aisle and a little bit of watering down to bring some Republicans across, the American Healthcare Reform Act was signed into law by President Romney to the relative chagrin of many Republicans he pleaded with to support the law. With re-election around the corner there is muted praise from the democratic candidates and even former Vice President Crist, who since departing early this year has started what some called a hopeless campaign for the Democratic Party’s nomination just one week prior to the signing.</p><p>While the last three years have indeed been confusing politically, Romney’s rather sturdy sense of pride in the bill is evident as he recalled at the signing it was not ‘100% what everyone in this roomed wanted but it will 100% help many Americans, and I cannot think of a more noble and righteous goal in this office I have been bestowed.’</p><p>The question still lays on if the President’s bold bipartisan move will help or hurt him in the national theatre of political discourse but it is perhaps fitting to say this will without a shadow of a doubt be the most historically significant moment of his first term, perhaps with the exception of the success of Operation Neptune Spear this past spring. President Romney has absconded from Republican thinking of healthcare, will the party absconded from him next November and will he lose happily with a cleared conscience?</p>`)

They started innocently, asking what it was like growing up in segregated Birmingham, Alabama, until they took a darker tone.</p><p><b>Misha Lerner</b>, a student from Bethesda, asked the Secretary what she thought of the casualty rate of U.S. troops skyrocketing after President Giuliani's proposed troop surge went into effect.</p><p>The Secretary coldly stated, "It's a sad necessity following the disastrous state in which President Clark left the country."</p><p>She added: "I hope you understand that it was a very difficult time. We were all so terrified of another attack on the country. September 11 was the worst day of my life in government, watching 3,000 Americans die. Even under those most difficult circumstances, the president was not prepared to do something illegal, and I hope people understand that we were trying to protect the country."</p><p><b>Misha's mother warned the Secretary that the question her son had was even tougher</b>, "Are you going to end the war so people stop dying?"</p><p>"Nothing within President Giuliani's authority as Commander in Chief is off the table and we're doing everything we can to ensure this conflict comes to a swift conclusion soon. We will not abandon Iraq under any circumstances but we will look into alternative methods to wage war on terror to ensure another 9/11 never happens again."</p><p>The remarks drew criticism, with most claiming Secretary Rice alluded to the nuclear option.

<p><b>Josephine Moulds</b></p> <p>According to a leading international think tank, China will overtake the U.S. economy in the next two years and become the largest economy in the world by 2013.</p> <p>The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that due to the U.S. economy hitting its 7th consecutive quarter of GDP decline since President Brownback's "Great American Tax Experiment," China can overtake the U.S. economy by the end of 2012. Asa Johansson, senior economist at the OECD, said: "It is quite a shift in the balance of economic power we are going to see in the future."</p><p>The tax cuts were the largest in American history and caused massive budget shortfalls. To save the economy, the Republican House cut deep into education and transportation spending, which received an equally large backlash. When the 2010 midterms came, the massive majority Republicans held in both the Senate and House was obliterated. Now facing a volatile Democratic caucus, President Brownback has stubbornly barked at any reversal of his policies.</p><p>The global shockwave of the 2007-2008 global financial crash allowed this development's conditions to take place. Although the crash also hit China, the U.S. hit more significant downturns, and President Brownback's government mismanagement has turned what was once a recession into a full-scale depression, the likes of which hasn't been seen since the 1930s.</b></p><p>A bipartisan coalition is forming in the House and Senate, and it seeks to repeal most of the President's tax cuts despite his assurances that a bright future is ahead of the country. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led the movements to repeal the tax cuts shortly after the 2010 midterms saw Democrats retake the House in a strong rebuke of the President. Whether repealing the tax cuts can reverse China's emergence as the world's leading economy remains to be seen.</p><p><b>Thu 2 Jan 2011 07.11 EST</b></p>`)

<p>The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research met yesterday by conference call. At its meeting, the committee determined a trough in business activity in the US economy in June 2010. The trough marks the end of the recession that began in December 2007 and the beginning of an expansion.</p><p>The recession's length exceeded most economists' expectations following the sudden collapse of General Motors due to Congressional deadlock, which prevented any economic bailout of these corporations. Just two of the many American financial institutions collapsed during the heat of the recession in 2008 and would later be followed by the collapse of AIG, "American International Group" in February 2009."</p><p>President Wesley Clark, frustrated by the lack of action, chastised Congress often following his reelection and made it his first priority to break the congressional deadlock, eventually breaking a deal of a 450 Billion stimulus bill that established the TARP program, which would be used to bail out Bank of America.</p><p>The committee's declaration of the end of a recession does not mean that the economy has recovered. Most institutions have yet to get back on their feet, and most families across America still feel the effects of the recession.</p><p>The declaration was followed by President Clark, who stated, "Economists may believe the recession has ended, but American families are still struggling to pay their bills day to day, and it's our job to offer more relief to the American people. The Republican Congress begs to differ, with most Republican leadership opposing further aid, citing the budget.</p><p>"Due to the lack of improvement in the labor market, particularly the stubbornly high unemployment rate, the recovery still feels like a recession to many households," said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York.

<p><b>Updated March 4, 2011, 11:49 PM EST By NBC News</b></p> <p>President Clark's resurrection of the Home Owners Loan Corporation amid the 2008 financial crisis was a drastic solution, and to most at the time, it was necessary. The bill, which reestablished the corporation along with a 1.1 trillion dollar bailout, was put forward by Senator Hillary Clinton (New York) and was credited for the late surge in President Clark's re-election polling and eventual victory over his Republican opponent.</p><p>Today, the corporation accounts for nearly 15 percent of owner-occupied nonfarm mortgages. Many credit it as a necessary lifeline to millions of families across the United States.</p><p>However, Republican primary candidates feel much differently. Governor Rick Perry (Texas) has taken the lead in the discussion, blaming President Clark's "destructive homeownership policies" as the leading cause of the housing crisis. Other candidates like former Senator Rick Santorum, who ran in the 2008 Republican primaries, tend to agree. In particular, Santorum has been scrutinized after taking out a loan with the corporation himself when a tax assessment of his $2 million, five-acre home fell 25% in value. The former Senator's polling has dropped after the revelation came to light.</p><p>President Clark and the Democratic Party have stood by the corporation and hailed it as a success despite the sluggish economy. Vice President Landrieu has staked part of her presidential campaign on allowing the corporation to continue its work in the face of Republican calls to disband it.</p><p>As Democrats pick up the pieces of the steep losses during the midterms, the corporation's results have become a beacon of light for the party to coalesce around. It's hard to deny that the message "We kept you in your homes" isn't powerful. Republican deficit hawks claim billions of dollars are wasted within the corporation's work, but polls show at least 55% of Americans approve of the Home Owners Loan Corporation, while 39% disapprove and 6% are unsure.</p>`)

Critics from her left often point to her past stances of supporting a state's right to decide, but she's recently clarified that she's always personally supported gay marriage.</p><p>Republicans reeling from the devastating loss in the 2008 election seem energized against this ruling, with multiple candidates like Governor Rick Perry who issued a statement, "I am disappointed the Supreme Court today chose to change the centuries old definition of marriage as between one man and one woman. I'm a firm believer in traditional marriage, and I also believe the 10th Amendment leaves it to each state to decide this issue.
