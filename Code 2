<p><b>Opinion:</b> <u>President John McCain rode into the White House on the economic woes of the Clark Administration. He's a man elected not because what he brought to the table was popular but because the other guy was an idiot.</b> <p>The complete collapse of the president's mandate proves that. Democrats nationwide ran on four words: "He Killed Social Security." The McCain administration knew this insurmountable task was unpopular, and his trips throughout the states to make the bill to reform the system seem popular only hurt its public view. McCain's refusal to cut taxes as a compromise for the bill eliminated all and any support from the opposition. However, what hurt him most was the collapse of the support within the Republican base. The old folk who relied on Social Security felt uncomfortable with his reforms. Regardless, by the summer of 09, he didn't seem to waver in supporting such a plan.</p><p>Public opinion hit a boiling point, but McCain still had the numbers to get what he wanted to be passed. So he ignored the normality of representing the people and forced upon America a "tough pill to swallow." Democrats tried to pull any tricks they could to combat the bill, but they lacked the numbers to stop it, and Republicans sent the bill through. Well, now, here we are. The American people have rejected the McCain administration's pill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has the numbers to comfortably stalemate whatever McCain may bring from here. It looks like President McCain has accepted the fact that his domestic agenda has been slain and has set his eyes abroad. The redeployment of troops into Iraq and Afghanistan was only the start of McCain's war-hungry agenda.</p><br><b>Politico Coverage</b><br><span style="color:white;"><u>Senator Russ Feingold launched a political action committee to explore the possibility of running for president in the 2012 election.</span></u><br><span style="color:white;"><u>Senator-elect Charlie Crist announces he will caucus with the Democratic Party.</span></u><br><span style="color:white;"><u>Governor Dave Freudenthal's gamble on challenging Wyoming Governor term limits paid off, reelected by slim margins.</p>`)

<p><b>Phoenix (Reuters) - </b> Republican John McCain lost Tuesday's presidential election in an upset at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The veteran Senator, whose poll numbers had surged to astronomical numbers in September, came crashing down by election day.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts on all sides of the aisle were scratching their heads. How could this happen? President Clark had completely crashed his campaign by attacking Senator McCain's service.</p><p>Clark's apology for such remarks was equally unpopular and most pathetic. The President's approval rating with veterans had dropped to dangerously low levels.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Senator's hopes and dreams faded on election night.</p><p>Eight years after his original presidential campaign in 2000, Senator McCain often came off as a polished statesman with a respectable record.</p><p>But the surprise outcome isn't one without some reasoning. The Senator's selection of Democrat Joe Lieberman had stirred much criticism from his right flank, culminating in the surge of the Reform Party nominee Pat Buchanan.</p><p>In a solemn concession speech, Senator McCain reflected on his own mistakes and offered nothing but goodwill to the President.</p><p>"This was a difficult campaign but I'm proud of our enthusiastic support," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Phoenix. "Now it's time for our nation to heal and I hope all the best for our nation and President Clark."</p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said McCain's choice for Vice President had been the most obvious source to blame for the defeat.</p><p>"Senator McCain was often cautioned that a move of picking a running mate from the opposite party would come to this."</p><p>The financial crisis that erupted in September, followed by President Clark's remarks on Face The Nation, had seemingly given McCain an untouchable lead. Gallup polls in late September showed the Senator 15 points ahead of Clark.</p><p><b>OVERCONFIDENCE, BAD OPTICS</b></p><p>It's unavoidable that at least some reason McCain lost comes down simply to Joe Lieberman's selection. A pro-choice Democrat with a strong gay rights record was too much for the Republican base to consider.</p><p>He championed national security concerns and a return to a respectable foreign policy but often neglected the bread and butter issues like abortion. Lieberman only helped double down on these issues, limiting the campaign's range.</p><p>The financial crisis also put conservatism as an ideology under much speculation. While President Clark responded calmly and firmly, Senator McCain's proposals didn't go far enough. The offer of tax cuts and reigning in government spending during a crisis and calamity had fallen flat.</p><p>Aides of the Clark Administration seem equally bewildered by the outcome.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that anyone will ever have an easier and more advantaged political climate than Senator McCain was given." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top McCain campaign officials say that the outcome also blindsided McCain.</p><p>What about Lieberman? To most, McCain's pick for Vice President did nothing to sew ties with the right flank and potentially tanked the veteran Senator's campaign.</p><p>High-profile Republicans such as former Senator Rick Santorum rejected McCain partially because of Lieberman.</p><p>"McCain spent the entire summer drawing a contrast between his conservativism and Clark's liberalism and Lieberman through all that through the window," said Republican strategist Scott Reed. "(But) you can't blame Lieberman for the loss. He reigned in the moderate Democrats..."”</p><p>McCain senior adviser Nicolle Wallace said the Arizona senator got a rough deal electorally from Buchanan, who "sabotaged" the Republican ticket. As a result, President Clark was able to revive a long-dead electoral coalition in the South held together by ancestral Democrats, sometimes winning states while barely holding 40% of the vote share.</p><p>"No objective analysis suggests that the Clark campaign wasn't directly helped by Buchanan. It's fair to assume Democrats did their fair share of spreading the word of Buchanan's candidacy."

<p><b>New York City (Reuters) - </b> Republican Rudy Giuliani lost Tuesday's presidential election in a humiliating defeat at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The celebrity Mayor, whose fame in politics could only be rivaled by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, was expected to take the polls by storm but came up short.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts said his many weaknesses were exposed little by little. The firefighter revolting, his affairs, his ties to Bernard Kerik—it all came crashing down on him. President Clark dutifully exploited this and made the election more about Rudy's blemishes than the disaster he brewed in Iraq, not to mention the collapsing economy.</p><p>Giuliani's attempts to portray President Clark as a tax-raising socialist who let terrorists take over Iraq grew stale with moderates, and whatever gains he made with them, he lost double the evangelicals in the South.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President with a sputtering economy and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Mayor lost by the fundamentals in running a campaign.</p><p>After 7 years of preparing his political ascendancy to the presidency, Giuliani entered with a monumental lead and was ready to take on the issues of the working class.</p><p>But the Mayor failed to respond to the crisis with effective language, at times sounding callous and heartless and sometimes aloof to the troubles facing everyday Americans. Party strategists point to Giuliani's incoherent economic messaging, which ranged from conservative to the same "Nanny" approach he often criticized.</p><p>In a difficult-to-hear concession speech late Tuesday, the former Mayor reflected on the campaign and seemingly struggled to accept blame for his failure.</p><p>"When I think back to everything I accomplished this campaign, I'm proud of the work I've done for you," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in New York. We fought hard for those who felt abandoned by Democrats and for the people we lost on 9/11."</p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said Giuliani's deep ties to the Bush administration might have ended up becoming a net negative with sore wounds prevailing from Iraq.</p><p>"He was always seen next to Bush advisors like Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld. People who were well known to the general public as war propeteers."</p><p>The financial crisis that erupted in September had seemingly solidified Giuliani's victory to most, but in early October, evidence of him paying off a mistress with city funds resurfaced, blowing through much of the Mayor's lead.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, MASSIVE GAFFES</b></p><p>Giuliani deeply wounded himself after refusing to answer a question about whether or not he'd pardon his former associate Bernard Kerik if elected president. Among other gaffes, he often became his own worst enemy.</p><p>He championed himself as someone above it all while being in touch with people's needs. This backfired on many of his proposals, and Giuliani often came off as elitist and running on vanity.</p><p>The financial crisis also put Giuliani's "conservativism" under speculation. While President Clark came off as calm and strong in his response, the Mayor appeared aloof to what Americans needed. This was especially so when he got into a public feud with Senator Hillary Clinton over her broad economic plan, including freezing foreclosures nationwide.</p><p>Aides say Giuliani's response to the economic crisis muddied the debate and gave President Clark an opening.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that anyone will ever have an easier and more advantaged political climate than Mayor Giuliani was given." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Giuliani aids say the Mayor is deeply bitter about his former campaign allies, like Senator Sam Brownback, calling on him to drop out of the race in favor of his running mate, Representative Mike Pence of Indiana.</p><p>What about Pence?

The Libertarian-minded Congressman, whose unorthodox positions on most issues were expected to shake up the race heavily, sadly, it didn't shake how he hoped it would.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts said his repudiation of the establishment and Senator Rick Santorum's third-party bid were among his greatest challenges to overcome. The old newsletters, past racist and antisemitic remarks, his unpopular platform—it all came crashing down on him. President Clark dutifully exploited this to avoid the challenge of his revolting left flank and set the theme of the election on Paul's unpopularity.</p><p>Paul's unstable coalition, bound by opposing President Clark's neoliberalism, ran out of steam short of its destination, and whatever gains he made with left-wing activists cost him conservative votes in the South.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Congressman failed to grasp the fundamentals of most issues.</p><p>Eighteen years after his initial run for President with the libertarian label, he was expected to champion the anti-war coalition's banner, but a third-party sabotage candidacy drained him with key Republican demographics.</p><p>But Paul's greatest failure was of his own making. His record was electoral poison, especially when his stance on Social Security was brought to the forefront, scaring the Republican base of the 65-and-older crowd. Furthermore, he alienated the traditional Republican farm states with his outspoken criticism of farm subsidies.</p><p>In a tough-pill-to-swallow concession speech, the Representative noted the massive achievement this election was for the libertarian movement.</p><p>"We may have lost, but the ideas brought forth prove that the libertarian experiment can be accomplished," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Dallas.

He was too relaxed on social issues and let's not even get started on his foreign policy."</p><p>The financial crisis that erupted in September had seemingly boosted confidence in his candidacy, but when it came to solutions to the crisis, the appeal slowly faded away.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, SCATHING SCRUTINY</b></p><p>Paul suffered heavy losses after his association with the Ron Paul Newsletter was brought to the forefront of the campaign, which highlighted past racist and antisemitic remarks.</p><p>He championed himself as the choice of both the anti-war left and right but found that these two groups were incompatible on several issues like abortion and economics.</p><p>The financial crisis initially vindicated Paul's platform as he championed ideas like ending the Federal Reserve. While President Clark focused on bailing financial institutions, Paul advocated smashing the established financial norms. The movement he sparked drew crowds, but its limited reach grew apparent when most desperately pleaded for a firm government response.</p><p>Aides say Paul's response to the crisis, while helping keep a dedicated following, did little to combat the stigma of Paul as a radical.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that any Republican will collapse in the fasion that the Paul campaign has." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Paul aides say the Congressman is bitter and frustrated over the surprisingly popular conservative party candidacy of Rick Santorum.</p><p>What about Johnson? To most, Paul's selection of former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson only doubled down on his outsider appeal and further drove a divide between Paul and the Republican establishment.</p><p>Paul's Press Secretary Jesse Benton commented that the Republican establishment lost them this campaign.</p><p>"There's no doubt that the Republican establishments refusal to get behind our campaign lost us this election," Benton told reporters at the Giuliani campaign headquarters in New York.

Asa Johansson, senior economist at the OECD, said: "It is quite a shift in the balance of economic power we are going to see in the future."</p><p>The tax cuts were the largest in American history and caused massive budget shortfalls.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led the movements to repeal the tax cuts shortly after the 2010 midterms saw Democrats retake the House in a strong rebuke of the President.

<p><b>u/libertarians</b></p><p><b>u/mayoforsam</b></p> <p>I know it's a tired joke, but seriously, where the hell is Mike Pence? I'm starting to miss the days when I could turn on my TV to watch President Giuliani's press conferences, where Pence would fan him with a giant feather while Condi fed him fruits until he'd occasionally answer a question about the invasion of Libya.</p><p> It was good entertainment hearing the president bring up 9/11 while justifying why we needed to bulldoze another random country. So what happened? Where's the shop bitch of the White House?</p><p>Secretary Rice is the one we get to see the most since she's the one busy covering for Giuliani's ass. All those failures in Libya? Benghazi? Please, Giuliani is a celebrity posing as the "acting president" now. Anyone with a brain and two working eyes can see that given State Department goon, John Kerry is the Democrat's pick for president, it's obvious that Rudy's incompetent foreign agenda has brought back old feuds.</p><p>This is a battle of foreign policy intellect, and Condoleezza Rice is in the hot seat, facing off against low approval ratings and Kerry being a popular face of the State Department. The media haven't picked up the sidelining of Pence, but it's pretty clear that his role in the administration is slowly being diminished in favor of laying the groundwork for President Rice's third term in 2016.</p><p>I wouldn't be confident in her shoes since most issues give Kerry the upper hand because Giuliani's inept economic policies have done nothing for American families.</p><p>Still, I'll be kicking up my feet no matter which deep-state puppet wins. Don't blame me; I'm voting for Randall Terry.</p>`)

Welcome to Astro's Variable Headquarters
This is a fairly simple function you can add to your mods. It will create a little menu in which the player can view the numbers laid out within the functions.
This is a great way to give the player a little more information about your mod.

Across this code, you will find a lot of aspects you can edit. I have left plenty of comments to help you understand what each part does.
Don't be afraid to ask in #mod-help on the Discord for clarification or help with editing this code.

To use this, place this code below your Code 2, and edit it as needed. You can duplicate the 'let a = document.createElement('p');' section to add more lines of text.

Functions are referenced in text like so: ' + function + '. This will display the number from the function in the text.
Credit to Nina, who made the original code that summoned the new screen (originally for the 1960Red/1952Blue advisor screen)
Go ahead and use this code in your mods - just give me credit. I hope it helps you out!
