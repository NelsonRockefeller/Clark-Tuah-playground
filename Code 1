Harbingers of War hell-bent on abusing the mandate bestowed by tragedy led to a crowded but divided opposition. Looking outward for an answer of any kind, the Democrats poached General Wesley K. Clark, who quickly rose to the challenge, beating out weak fringe candidates and, against all the odds, beating President George W. Bush.\n<p>\nWith victory secured, he must take on new conquests, mapping his way through entrenched party lines in Congress or skipping the swamps to repair the alliances that Bush torched. However, as the economy begins to show signs of worry, it's unknown whether he'll be able to fly toward an easy victory.",

Well, the gold these Democrats saw was an impeccable resume that proved capable of beating Bush. The kicker is how badly Democrats misunderstood the man. \n\n<p>He is his own action figure, believing to be above the fray of party and congressional politics. He is the 12 Knights of the Round Table or the Three Wise Men all in one. Blessed with Athenic-like wisdom and knowledge, no matter who is locked in the room with him, he's the smartest man.
