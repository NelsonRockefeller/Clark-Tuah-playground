When General Wesley Clark came onto the political scene, Republicans had trouble nailing him. His career was not of politics but military conquests in the Balkans, in which he came victorious. Promising a bold course redirection, he steered a powerful coalition to victory.\n<p>\nWith victory secured, he must take on new conquests, mapping his way through entrenched party lines in Congress or skipping the swamps to repair the alliances that Bush torched. However, as the economy begins to show signs of worry, it's unknown whether he'll be able to fly toward an easy victory.",
